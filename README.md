I try to analyze the factors governing the Li-ion diffusivity of electrolyze materials for solid-state Li-ion battery. Our objective is to work out a plot of feature importance to showcase which features (say, ionic radius) that mostly contribute to the Li-ions diffusivity. In the attached dataset (json file), we have 4134 data points.
